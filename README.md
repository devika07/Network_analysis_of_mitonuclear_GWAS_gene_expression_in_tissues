# Network_analysis_of_mitonuclear_GWAS_gene_expression_in_tissues
study gene expression accross 32 human tissues  

(1) geneExpressionBoxplot.r 
Generate boxplot of gene expression levels of gene sets in each tissue.

(2) geneExpressionSignificanceTest.r 
Pairwise comparison (by Wilcoxon Rank Sum test) of gene expression levels of each disease gene set with that of background genes (e.g. protein-coding genes).

(3) geneExpressionFiles (folder)
The gene expression of each gene sets in 32 tissues (in the following order: "ADIPOSE","ADRENAL GLAND","ANIMAL OVARY","APPENDIX","BLADDER","BONE MARROW","CEREBRAL CORTEX","COLON","DUODENUM","ENDOMETRIUM","ESOPHAGUS","FALLOPIAN TUBE","GALL BLADDER","HEART","KIDNEY","LIVER","LUNG","LYMPH NODE","PANCREAS","PLACENTA","PROSTATE","RECTUM","SALIVARY GLAND","SKELETAL MUSCLE","SKIN","SMALL INTESTINE","SMOOTH MUSCLE","SPLEEN","STOMACH","TESTIS","THYROID","TONSIL").
